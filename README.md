Inspired by "Papers, Please", this game aims to highlight the logical fallacies of password creation through the lens of a scammer. You check criteria, question users about their habits and practices, and leverage day-to-day knowledge to pay off your loan and keep your nefarious business afloat.

All of this game's code was originally developed by Tempetus Cabinet​. We ended up twisting the game's logic (characters you would normally 'deny' were 'accepted' because of their bad security practices + easy to manipulate behaviors), changing some assets with Adobe Express and Asperite, and adding some new variables in Godot -- but the base game remains the same. A huge thank you to Tempetus for leaving their code publicly available. We do not claim any rights to the code used in this project. 

This game was made as a final project for IS 393 (Usable Security & Privacy) -- Fall 2025 by Jillian J., Justin T., and Kapila M. (JJK).
